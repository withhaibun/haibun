# Scaffolding

You can scaffold Haibun into an existing or new project using `npx -p @haibun/utils scaffold`.
This will add the core library, Typescript and unit test support (if missing),
steppers, a placeholder library, and tests.
It won't overwrite existing files. It presumes a `src` folder for source files.

# Virtual capture

Audio/video virtualized captures (vcapture) can be added to projects using the `run-vcapture` command
with the following options:

[--recreate] [--tts] [--no-capture] [--help] [--res WxH] script filter features â€¦folders

`script` is the package.json script to run for the script,
`filter` is the feature filter to use (or ""),
and `folders` is individual folders that need to be mounted in the container
to execute the tests (for example, `features assets`).

See [Haibun e2e tests](https://github.com/withhaibun/haibun-e2e-tests/blob/package.json) for an example.

This feature requires Docker Compose to be installed on the host system.

## Options

`--recreate`: Re-create the container

`--tts`: uses local Kokoro text-to-speech.

Any prose lines in the tests, along with headings like "Scenario" will be spoken (using kokoro-tts).

Runtime options should be passed to package.json script commands using `-- --option`.
