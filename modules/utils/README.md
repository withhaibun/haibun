# Scaffolding

You can scaffold Haibun into an existing or new project using `npx -p @haibun/utils scaffold`. 
This will add the core library, Typescript and Jest support (if missing), 
steppers, a placeholder library, and tests. 
It won't overwrite existing files. It presumes a `src` folder for source files.
