Feature: Haibun Overview: From Single-Family Home to Triplex

This feature file provides a comprehensive overview of the Haibun framework.
It uses the practical example of converting a single-family home into a triplex.
The entire process is documented as a series of clear, verifiable steps.
This approach is designed to be easily understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
What follows is a living document that is both a project plan and an executable test suite.

Scenario: A complete, verifiable renovation project

The project begins with a clear goal: convert a single-family home into a triplex.
To manage this complex undertaking, I will track all costs and timelines from the very beginning.
set "costs/total" to 0
set "time/total" to 0

The first phase of the project is all about due diligence and planning.
This involves navigating a complex web of regulations and hiring a team of specialists.
It is the foundation upon which the entire project is built.
ensure Ensure I have reviewed federal regulations
ensure Ensure I have reviewed provincial regulations
ensure Ensure I have hired all necessary specialists
ensure Ensure I have met urban planning requirements

With the regulatory and planning groundwork laid, the next step is to secure funding and incentives.
This can significantly impact the financial viability of the project.
I will explore all available government programs to offset the costs.
ensure Ensure I have checked for federal incentives
ensure Ensure I have checked for provincial incentives
ensure Ensure I have checked for urban incentives

A construction project of this scale will have an impact on the local community.
To maintain good relationships, it is important to be transparent and communicative.
I will notify the neighbors and the wider community before any work begins.
ensure Ensure I have notified the community

With all the planning, permits, and notifications in place, there is one final step.
The occupancy permit is the official authorization that the new triplex is safe to live in.
This is the ultimate goal of the entire project.
ensure Obtain occupancy permit

The project is now complete.
The following is a summary of the total estimated cost and time for the conversion.
This report is generated automatically from the steps that were executed.
It provides a clear and verifiable record of the project's key metrics.

This concludes the Haibun overview.
As you have seen, Haibun allows you to create a detailed, narrative-driven project plan.
Each step in the plan is an executable action, making the entire document a testable specification.
This approach bridges the gap between the project's description and its implementation.
It ensures that the plan is always up-to-date and accurately reflects the reality of the project.
