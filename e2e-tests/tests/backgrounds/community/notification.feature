It is important to be a good neighbor.
Before construction begins, I will inform the community about the project.
This helps manage expectations and maintain good relationships.

Activity: Ensure I have notified the community
    ensure Mail notification letters to immediate neighbors
    ensure Post a sign on the property about the conversion

These steps ensure that the community is aware of the upcoming work.

Activity: Mail notification letters to immediate neighbors
    A friendly letter to the immediate neighbors will explain the scope and timeline of the project.
    It will also provide contact information for any questions or concerns.
    add 100 to "costs/total"
    add 2 to "time/total"
    set "community/notification/letters" to "sent"
    waypoint "Notification letters" sent to neighbors with variable "community/notification/letters" is "sent"

Activity: Post a sign on the property about the conversion
    A public sign on the property will provide a general overview of the project for the wider community.
    It will also include the permit number and contact information for the general contractor.
    add 250 to "costs/total"
    add 1 to "time/total"
    set "community/notification/sign" to "posted"
    waypoint "Public notification sign" posted with variable "community/notification/sign" is "posted"
