The federal government offers several incentives to encourage energy-efficient home renovations.
I will explore these options to reduce the overall project cost.

Activity: Ensure I have checked for federal incentives
    ensure Apply for federal tax credits for energy-efficient windows
    ensure Apply for grants for replacing old HVAC systems

This activity involves researching and applying for relevant federal programs.
The estimated time includes gathering documentation and filling out forms.

Activity: Apply for federal tax credits for energy-efficient windows
    The tax credit for new windows can significantly reduce my tax burden.
    This is a direct credit, not a deduction, making it quite valuable.
    add -2000 to "costs/total"
    add 4 to "time/total"
    set "federal/incentives/windows" to "applied"
    waypoint Applied for federal incentive "tax credits for windows" with variable "federal/incentives/windows" is "applied"

Activity: Apply for grants for replacing old HVAC systems
    Replacing the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system is a major expense.
    A federal grant can cover a substantial portion of this cost.
    add -3000 to "costs/total"
    add 8 to "time/total"
    set "federal/incentives/hvac" to "applied"
    waypoint Applied for federal incentive "HVAC grant" with variable "federal/incentives/hvac" is "applied"
